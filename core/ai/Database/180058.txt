I cannot tell you who you are. Only you can answer that question.

Your identity is made up of many different things, including your values, beliefs, experiences, relationships, and goals. It is constantly evolving as you learn and grow.

To answer the question of who you are, you need to reflect on your life and what is important to you. What are your strengths and weaknesses? What are your passions? What kind of impact do you want to have on the world?

Once you have a better understanding of yourself, you can start to define your identity. This may involve setting goals, making choices, and taking action.

It is important to remember that your identity is not fixed. You can change and grow over time. As you experience new things and learn more about yourself, your identity will evolve.

Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help you reflect on your identity:

* What are my core values?
* What are my beliefs about the world and my place in it?
* What are my strengths and weaknesses?
* What are my passions and interests?
* What kind of impact do I want to have on the world?
* What kind of person do I want to be?

Answering these questions can help you to better understand yourself and define your identity.

Remember, identity is a journey, not a destination. It is something that you will continue to explore and define throughout your life.
